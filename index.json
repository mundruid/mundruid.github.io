However, these devices are lacking in security measures due to their low time to market and insufficient funding for security research and development. In order to improve the security of IoTs, we have defined novel security metrics based on generic IoT characteristics. Furthermore, we have developed automation for experimentation with IoT devices that results to repeatable and reproducible calculations of security metrics within a realistic IoT testbed. Our results demonstrate that repeatable IoT security measurements are feasible with automation. They prove quantitatively intuitive hypotheses. For example, an large number of inbound / outbound network connections contributes to higher probability of compromise or measuring password strength leads to a robust estimation of IoT security.","tags":[],"title":"IoT Metrics and Automation for Security Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Casey Wilson","Xenia Mountrouidou","Anna Little"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611014400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611014400,"objectID":"e3b60021221c0c7e7aa5269e75debc0b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/cyberhunt2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cyberhunt2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Time as a variable for generating features has been widely overlooked in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) research. Computer and network attacks are time series, where time is an important factor that may affect feature generation, and as a result, classification. Nevertheless, there has been little exploration on how to calibrate time for IDSs and attack classification techniques. In this paper we explore time windows as a technique for generating more effective and descriptive features for attack classification. We suggest a framework for feature generation and selection that uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and time window exploration. Our initial results when applying this framework indicate that there is up to 47% improvement of F1 scores in attack classification when attack features are generated over a variety of time windows, compared to a single, global time window. We find that features calculated over longer lengths of time may be more useful for detecting attacks than over shorter lengths of time. Our methods seem to be most effective at detecting DDoS attacks, particularly those that occur over medium or long durations of time.","tags":[],"title":"Worth the wait?
