      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next generation of cybersecurity engineers will be data engineers who happen to specialize in cybersecurity. This talk aims at showing how cybersecurity engineers can benefit from todayâ€™s technology to make sense of the sea of data that they are gathering. Currently, we are constantly bombarded with information about GPT, ML, AI, and a variety of abbreviations. The question is, though, how can we as cybersecurity engineers capitalize on these tools? I will answer this question with a concrete example of the usage of ML and AI from the perspective of a cybersecurity researcher. The goal of this project is to invent creative ways of deciphering cybersecurity data with ML and AI.&lt;/p&gt;
